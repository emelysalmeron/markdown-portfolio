I think one of **my best strengths** :muscle: its that I am very *perseverant person* :fire:. I dont literally give up that easily. How I discover this? my mom :woman: told me:
>_Wow! Emely you dont really give up, thatÂ´s perverance!_

So I decided to google :computer: what is perseverance I found this: 

>persistent in doing something _despite difficulty; unwavering_.
>"you need to be **spirited and perseverant** :fire: to drive your projects through"
